                <p>There are 42 questions in total. 6 questions about 7 doctors.</p>
                <p>From the 1st Doctor back in the 60's to the 7th Doctor in the 80's.</p>
                <p>The TV movie is the dividing line between classic Who and regenerated Who and is therefore not included in this quiz.</p>
                <p>When you press START a question will be displayed and the 30 second countdown will begin.</p>
                <p>Each question has 3 possible answers. Only one answer is correct.</p>
                <p>You can make the question easier to answer by selecting EASY to remove one of the incorrect answers.</p>
                <p>Get the answer correct and the answer button will turn green. Get it wrong and it will turn red and the correct button will turn green.</p>
                <p>You score 2 points for a correct answer. Unless you selected EASY in which case a correct answer scores 1 point.</p>
                <p>Each time a question is displayed the 30 second countdown resets and begins again.</p>
                <p>The game ends when you answer incorrectly or the timer reaches zero.</p>
                <p>How well do you know your classic Who?</p>
                <p>Here's a question to get you started (no points just kudos), Do you know why there are 42 questions in this quiz?</p>
