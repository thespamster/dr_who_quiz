                <p>There are 42 questions in total. 6 questions about 7 doctors.</p>
                <p>From the 1st Doctor William Hartnell to the 7th Doctor Sylvester McCoy.</p>
                <p>The TV movie is the dividing line between classic Who and regenerated Who and is therefore not included in this quiz.</p>
                <p>When you press START a question will be displayed and the 30 second countdown will begin.</p>
                <p>Each question has 3 possible answers. Only one answer is correct.</p>
                <p>You can simplify the quiz by selecting SIMPLIFY to remove one of the incorrect answers.</p>
                <p>You score 2 points for a correct answer. Unless you simplified in which case you only score 1 point for a correct answer.</p>
                <p>Each time a question is displayed the 30 second countdown resets and begins again.</p>
                <p>The game ends when you answer incorrectly or the timer runs down to zero.</p>
                <p>How well do you know your classic Who?</p>
                <p>Here's a question to get you started (no points just kudos), Do you know why there are 42 questions in this quiz?</p>
